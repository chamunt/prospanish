1) Ammeters measure electric [current].
It's measured in [amperes], A.
2) Remember - current doesn't get [used] up in a circuit.
So the current through the ammeter and the bulb are the [same].
3) You can connect the ammeter [anywhere] in the circuit.
Voltmeters Measure Potential Difference:
1) Voltmeters measure potential difference in [volts], V.
2) You measure the potential difference between two [points]
in the circuit. For example, either side of a [bulb].
Batteries and Bulbs Have Potential Difference Ratings:
1) A battery potential difference rating tells you
the [potential] difference it will supply.
2) A bulb rating tells you the [maximum].
