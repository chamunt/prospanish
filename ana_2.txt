Electric Circuits:
Current is the flow of [charge] (negative [electrons]) around a circuit.
Current doesn’t get used up (think of water getting [pumped] around a fountain)
The [battery] is like a pump, it’s the driving force that pushes the [charge] around the [circuit].
This is call the Potential Difference (PD) – the higher the PD or [voltage] the faster or higher the current/charge will be. 
[Resistance] slows down the flow of [current]. Resistance is measured in [ohms] (Ω).
The formula to work out how much [resistance] there is in a circuit is:
Resistance = [PD] ÷ [Current]
